			<h2>Company History</h2>
			<p>Our company was founded in 2019 by a team of passionate entrepreneurs who saw an opportunity to streamline the bus ticket booking process. We started small, working with a handful of bus operators in our local area, but quickly grew to become one of the most popular online booking platforms in the region. Today, we serve thousands of customers every day and are constantly expanding our network of bus operators to offer even more choices to our customers.</p>
